## Overview and Requirements

**In this project, I learned how to create my own portfolio for job applications as well as a good way to display what I have learned so far since the project took everything we have done and tasked us with putting it all together.**
## General requirements (30 pts):

Create and deploy a personal website on GitHub cloud (github.io) as a professional profile with your resume, including your name, headshot, contact information, background, e.g., education, your experiences and skills.

**I was able to put together this display of my skills, education and what degree I am working on.**
## (25 pts).
Create a link to a new HTML page to introduce this "Web Application Programming and Hacking" course and related hands-on projects (5 pts)

**I linked that under most of the technical requirements**
## Non-technical requirements (20 pts)

Use an open-source CSS template or framework such as Bootstrap

Target this profile for your potential employer, and your page will be graded as a part of your job application

   Include a page tracker, for example: https://analytics 

Links to an external site.](https://analytics.withgoogle.com/ Links to an external site.), https://flagcounter.com/

**I used the basic bootstrap css template to display my work and give it a bit of a theme, I also linked the page tracker at the bottom of the page.**
## Technical requirements (50 pts)
## Basic JavaScript code (20 pts)

Use jQuery and one more open-source JavaScript framework/library to implement JavaScript code introduced in Lab 2, including a digital clock, an analog clock, show/hide your email, and one more functionality of your choice. (5 pts each)

**I added each of these and opted to go with clicking to show the time as my addition in the functionality**

Two public Web APIs integration (20 pts) Ensure you include a disclaimer stating that the public/third-party services generate the generated contents below and that you are not responsible. 

**I added both of the WEB APIs and the disclaimer that says I am not responsible for them**

Integrate the jokeAPI (https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke/Any 

Links to an external site., similar to Lab 2.2.d.i) with Any category of joke to display a new joke in your page every 1 minute.
